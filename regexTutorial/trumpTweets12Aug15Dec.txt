Israel was very respectful &amp; nice to Rep. Rashida Tlaib allowing her permission to visit her ‚Äúgrandmother.‚Äù As soon as she was granted permission she grandstanded &amp; loudly proclaimed she would not visit Israel. Could this possibly have been a setup? Israel acted appropriately! [Twitter for iPhone]

Rep. Tlaib wrote a letter to Israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. Permission was quickly granted whereupon Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down a complete setup.
